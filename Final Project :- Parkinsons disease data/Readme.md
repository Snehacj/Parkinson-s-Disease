  <h1>Overview</h1>
  Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.The main risk factor is age, because Parkinson's disease is most commonly found in adults over the age of 50 (although diagnoses can occur in much younger people). Men also have a higher risk of Parkinson's disease than women.
